|<a href = "Reinforcement Learning Toolkit">Reinforcement Learning Toolkit</a>| This is a part of reinforcement learning course at University of South Dakota. This is a toolkit for reinforcement learning algorithms. It has implementation of Markov Decision Process from scratch. Other algorithms will be added soon.|
|<a href = "Pyspark Recommendation System">Pyspark Recommendation System</a>| This is a project done as a part of my masters course. The project is a recommendation system built using pyspark. The dataset used is the book recommendation dataset. The project uses cloud storage, mongodb, pyspark, and hdfs.|
|<a href = "https://www.i8labs.com/">Multi Object Tracker</a>| I worked on this project while working at leapfrog technologies. The project is a multi object tracking system built using jetson nano developer kit. The project uses deepsort, yolov3, and opencv. I worked mostly on the core tracking module and interfacing with the hardware|
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/Nepalese-PAN-extraction">Nepalese Pan Document Extractor</a>|This is a pan document extractor built using opencv and tesseract. The project uses opencv and tesseract to extract the pan document from the image and dumps the extracted data into MySQL database. |
|<a href = "https://foneloan.com.np/">Foneloan</a>| This is a big project I was a part of when I was working at Extensodata. It is a software that analasyses the financial transaction of the customers and makes a decision for credit approval. By integrating foneloan with the banking software, the customer can get pre approved loans up to a certain amount.|
