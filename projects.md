|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning Toolkit</a>| This is part of a reinforcement learning course at the University of South Dakota. This is a toolkit for reinforcement learning algorithms. It has an implementation of the Markov Decision Process from scratch. Other algorithms will be added soon.|
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/pyspark-recommentation">Pyspark Recommendation System</a>| This is a project done as a part of my master's course. The project is a recommendation system built using pyspark. The dataset used is the book recommendation dataset. The project uses cloud storage, MongoDB, pyspark, and hdfs.|
|<a href = 'https://github.com/siddhi47/streamlit-image-classification'>Image Classification (Streamlit UI)</a>| A simple demonstration of end-to-end ML cycle of CNN models using NGROK, Flask API, Streamlit, and Pytorch|
|<a href = "https://www.i8labs.com/">Multi Object Tracker</a>| I worked on this project while working at Leapfrog Technologies. The project is a multi-object tracking system built using a Jetson nano developer kit. The project uses deepsort, yolov3, and opencv. I worked mostly on the core tracking module and interfacing with the hardware|
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/Nepalese-PAN-extraction">Nepalese Pan Document Extractor</a>|This is a pan document extractor built using opencv and tesseract. The project uses opencv and Tesseract to extract the PAN document from the image and dump the extracted data into the MySQL database. |
|<a href = "https://foneloan.com.np/">Foneloan</a>| This is a big project I was a part of when I was working at Extensodata. It is software that analyses the customers' financial transactions and makes a decision for credit approval. By integrating Foneloan with the banking software, the customer can get pre-approved loans up to a certain amount.|
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/Cursor-Control-using-Eye-Movement">Cursor control using head and eye movement</a>| This is a project we did for the LITE competition held at Kantipur Engineering College. The project is a cursor control system built using opencv and Python. The project uses a webcam to track the head and eye movement of the user and control the cursor accordingly.|
|<a href = "https://bitbucket.org/siddhi47/ethereumvoting/src/master/voting/">Digital voting system using ethereum</a>|This is an ethereum voting system built using solidity and Django. The project was done as a part of an Engineering degree course. The project uses the ethereum blockchain to store the votes and Django to build the front end. |
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/mat2jpeg">Matlab Image converter</a>| A multithreaded approach for converting Matlab signals to mel spectrogram in jpeg. |
|<a href = "https://github.com/siddhi47/tensorflow_serving">Simple tensorflow serving</a>|A template for tensorflow serving |
